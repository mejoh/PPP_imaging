This folder contains scripts used to carry out dynamic causal modelling (DCM) of functional MRI data from the PersonalizedParkinsonProject. 'mj_DCM_batch' provides top-level control over the pipeline, which is kept as modular as possible. The intention is that you run through the to-do list in order, re-running the script for each item separately. The scripts are well-commented and you should be able to make adjustments as you see fit.
